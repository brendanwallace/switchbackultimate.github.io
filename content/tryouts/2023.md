Tryouts are set! Fill out our [form](https://forms.gle/BNT7k4RqhSHUEFRr9) for the 2023 season.

Two open tryouts:

1. Sunday May 21st, 4-7pm at Franklin HS (preferred for local players)

2. Monday June 5th, 6-9pm at QA Bowl Playfield

After each tryout we'll invite some players to team practices over the next
two weeks before offering a number of spots on the team.


If you were able to make our 4v4 tournament on April 30th thanks for coming.
We're excited to see you at our upcoming tryouts!
