Starting in April we'll have open scrimmages on Sundays (fill out our
interest form to stay up to date on the timing + location of those). 

We'll have one open tryout early-mid May, and one the second week of June.
Each will be followed by closed tryouts and a number of spots offered.

We may also invite some players to team mini/practices before then and will
offer a number of roster spots on a rolling basis.
