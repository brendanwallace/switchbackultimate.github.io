We'll have two open tryouts:

1. May 15th at Magnuson #5 from 2-5pm

2. June 4th at Franklin 6-9pm

After each tryout we'll invite some players to team practices over the next
week before offering a number of spots on the team.

Starting in April we'll have open scrimmages on Sundays (fill out the
tryout form to stay up to date on the timing + location of those).

We may also invite some players to team mini/practices before then and will
offer a number of roster spots on a rolling basis.
