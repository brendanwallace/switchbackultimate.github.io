## Values

We've talked a lot about how to diffuse the dynamics that can make men's
division experiences feel toxic as well as what we actively want in a team and
agreed on a set of core values:

- __Growth__

We seek and accept feedback and criticism, we're open to changing everything
from throwing form to decision-making, and we want to grow as individual players.

- __Support__

Everyone is part of a community and valued as a complete human being beyond just
what they can do on the field.


- __Openness__

We set goals, expectations, and agenda as a team and make them explicit.
We work to distill clarity about what individual and team success means, and
we try to communicate directly and early.

- __Play__

We learn by doing, prioritize touches and time spent moving, commit to
making the most of practice, and attend a lot of tournaments. Our goal
celebrations border on the absurd.


## History


Switchback was founded in 2022 by Connor Hannify, Camen Piho, Adam Fischette,
and Brendan Wallace.

The name Switchback is a reference to the natural
beauty of the pacific northwest and the trails that help make it accessible.
And it's a metaphor: switchbacks are a way to
make it up a mountain by taking a longer path with lots of turns and incremental
progress; they help accomplish something hard by breaking it into pieces; they
work only if you're open to going sideways to get forward.

Similarly, building a cohesive team and community that navigates
the conflicts of a competitive environment is hard,
it takes moving sideways to get forward and breaking challenges down
to manageable pieces.
We wanted to acknowledge that difficulty, and how we want to take a different
approach to what we've seen and experienced. A different path. A path that starts
at the base of a steep mountain, that curves and winds and bends but ultimately
heads high, high, high.


Come climb that mountain with us.
