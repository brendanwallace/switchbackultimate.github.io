Seattle should have another competitive men's team. The number of skilled male-matching players outnumber the available roster spots; at the same time, the men's team culture we want to be a part of doesn't exist yet.

Seattle Switchback is our answer: a men's team focused on finding positive team culture in a highly competitive environment.

We've talked a lot about how to best diffuse many of the dynamics that can make men's division experiences feel toxic, as well as what we actively want in a team, and agreed on a set of core values. These are:

- __Growth__: individual growth and openness

We seek and accept feedback and criticism, we're open to changing everything from throwing form to decision-making, and we want to grow as individual players.

- __Unity__: uniting around an explicit vision of our goals and how to work towards them

We set goals, expectations, and agenda as a team. We work to distill clarity about what individual and team success means, and believe buy-in is more important than short-term results.

- __Play__: commitment to making the most of our time through actual play

We learn by doing, prioritize touches and time spent playing, commit to making the most of practice, and attend a lot of tournaments.

The pursuit and embodiment of these values separates us from other teams in the men's division. Come climb the mountain with us.
