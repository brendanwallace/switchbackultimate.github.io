Seattle Switchback is a men's team focused on finding positive
team culture in a highly competitive environment.

We've talked a lot about how to diffuse the dynamics that can make men's
division experiences feel toxic as well as what we actively want in a team and
agreed on a set of core values:

- __Growth__

We seek and accept feedback and criticism, we're open to changing everything
from throwing form to decision-making, and we want to grow as individual players.

- __Support__

Everyone is part of a community and valued as a complete human being beyond just
what they can do on the field.


- __Openness__

We set goals, expectations, and agenda as a team and make them explicit.
We work to distill clarity about what individual and team success means, and
we try to communicate directly and early.

- __Play__

We learn by doing, prioritize touches and time spent moving, commit to
making the most of practice, and attend a lot of tournaments. Our goal
celebrations border on the absurd.

Come climb the mountain with us.
