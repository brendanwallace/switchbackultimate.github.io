title: Tryouts 2023
---


Expect things to get rolling in March or April.

Assuming we stick with the plan from last year, we'll have two tryout windows:
one starting in late April/early May for folks already in Seattle;
and another one starting towards the end of May â€“ primarily for folks
moving here or players in college who won't get back until later in the spring.
We're even aware some schools let out in June! Don't worry, we'll work with you
to make sure we can give everyone interested in the team a good look.

We'll be returning the core of our team from 2022 for the upcoming season.
We'll likely have 5-10 spots for new players on the roster and a handful of
practice player spots.

Check back for our interest form, and reach out if you might want to join us
for a mini game or a workout before then.

If you're new to Seattle and looking to get the lay of the land, we're happy
to help you there too.
