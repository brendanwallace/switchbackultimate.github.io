## Join the trail

Fill out our [interest form](https://forms.gle/mXe2dbm9eD8o33kL7) for the 2023 season.


Our first (unofficial) tryout event is here! A 4v4 hat tournament co-hosted
with women's team Underground on April 30th. [Sign up here.](http://bit.ly/4v4april30)

After that, we'll have two tryout windows:
One starting in late April/early May for folks already in Seattle;
and another one starting towards the end of May â€“ primarily for folks
moving here or players in college who won't get back until later in the spring.
We're even aware some schools let out in June! Don't worry, we'll work with you
to make sure we can give everyone interested in the team a good look.

We'll be returning the core of our team from 2022 for the upcoming season.
We'll likely have 5-10 spots for new players on the roster and a handful of
practice player spots.

Fill out our interest form, and we'll reach out when our full tryout form
goes live.

If you're new to Seattle and looking to get the lay of the land, we're happy
to help you there too.
