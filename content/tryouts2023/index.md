title: Tryouts 2023

(We're still working on this.)

Expect things to get rolling in March or April.

We'll be returning the core of our team from 2022 for the upcoming season.
We'll likely have 5-10 spots for new players on the roster and a handful of
practice player spots.

Check back for our interest form, and reach out if you might want to join us
for a mini game or a workout before then.

If you're new to Seattle and looking to get the lay of the land, we're happy
to help you there too.
