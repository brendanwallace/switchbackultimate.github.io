## Join the trail

Tryouts are set! Fill out our [form](https://forms.gle/BNT7k4RqhSHUEFRr9) for the 2023 season.

Two open tryouts:

1. Sunday May 21st, 2-5pm at Magnuson #5 (preferred for local players)

2. Monday June 5th, 6-9pm at QA Bowl Playfield

After each tryout we'll invite some players to team practices over the next
two weeks before offering a number of spots on the team.


Also consider attending our [4v4 tournament on April 30th](/4v4april30).
It's not officially a tryout, but we'd love to have you out and get to know you!
