We drafted Aaron "Glick" Glickman straight out of the minor leagues in
2022, now look at him: he's climbed the ladder all the way up to preseason
leadership.

Glick is often described as the heart and soul of the D line.
Glick's from the Greater Seattle Area - he played high school ball somewhere
I never remember the name of, then played college ball at Western Washington
for Dirt. He has a tattoo of a cast iron skillet that matches Nolan's, and
(unlike Nolan - at the time of writing this) actually owns a cast iron skillet
to back it up.

Glick is responsible for coining or popularizing several "Glickisms" now in
common use, most notably "unlucky, to be honest".

Fun facts:

- Glick once lost his glasses at MOAB when he flipped upside down from a rope
into a waterfall and almost drowned. He spent the next week wearing his backup
transition lens glasses which turned dark at hilarious and inappropriate times.
- Glick once built a computer model of a traffic roundabout which showed once
and for all that roundabouts > stoplights.
- Glick plays as the Scoundrel class in Gloomhaven where famously he deals
almost no damage to his enemies.
