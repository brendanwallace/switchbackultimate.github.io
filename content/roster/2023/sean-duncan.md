Sean Duncan is from New Jersey. He went to college in either Deleware or
Pittsburgh. Or maybe he's from Deleware or Pittsburgh but went to school in 
New Jersey? But he also went to college in Oregon. Has to be Oregon State, because
we make lots of jokes about beavers (the Oregon State mascott) about him. Not
really sure what that's about. Maybe a grad degree or something.

Sean used to play on Dark Star. Another point of evidence that he has some
affiliation with the state of Oregon.

Sean works as an engineer on structures related to water; possibly bridges
as well (dam adjacent. (see, beaver joke)). He's offsite doing "real
work" a lot, so he's sometimes running late to practice. He probably even wears
steel toed work boots and all that.

Catch Sean holding it down on the D line. Last season he got a lot of
hand blocks so that was cool!
