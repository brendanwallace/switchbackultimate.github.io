Max Bommarito is from Michigan. He's from Michigan so much that he has a tattoo
of a burning couch on his leg (he has told us that this is a Michigan thing).
He's a big fan of a twitter account that posts different types of maps of
Lansing, Michigan. He used to play for either Hybrid, or High Five, or
possibly practice for both of them. I'm pretty sure it was High Five but Joe
thinks Hybrid so I now think both is possible (but actually now that Joe's not
looking, it's definitely High Five).

Max is one of the founding members of Switchback but he really wanted the team
to be called "Tacoma Presents the Seattle Frisbee Friends."

Max likes glass cutting and stain-glass- making. He got
really into speed rock climbing a few months ago, now he's into bowling. Last
year he was learning how to count cards and he'd play blackjack for literally hours
at a time at casinos and I think he won like $1,000 one time.
