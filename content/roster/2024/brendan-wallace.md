Brendan "Bren-Dog" Wallace is one of the founding members and dreamers behind Switchback (and still in my phone as "Brendan Frisbee"). When Switchback was just a groupme with 3 people named "Seattle Playground" he fended off hundreds of folks wanting to change the name to "Tacoma Frisbee Friends" - No easy task. As captain of the 2022 team, Brendan introduced the world to Woodley-Mode.

Brendan is a big proponent of car free transportation and would love to talk about how we can build cities that do not cater to car culture. Wanna see his new E-Bike? Chances are it's on the other side of the park and you just want to stay put and stay warm playing mini.

Brendan is also the coach of what many are calling "The Greatest Show in Sports", the Lakeside Middle School Ultimate team. This team has taken down countless big names in Seattle frisbee. So many, in fact, that if we were to start listing those names here, we simply wouldnâ€™t have enough room.

Bren-Dog can often be found at one of his favorite restaurants and places to be Ha! He's there so often that when Ha! closed for Thanksgiving you could find Bren-Dog at the park playing football with the Ha! restaurant staff.
