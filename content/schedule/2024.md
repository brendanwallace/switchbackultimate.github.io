# 2024 Schedule

## Description

We envision three phases to the season:

#### Phase I. Capitalize on initial excitement; make progress on team goals and learn systems

This phase kicks off with a big practice weekend (PW1), the team attends Eugene Summer Solstice, possibly Pro Elite Challenge, and Select Flight Invite.
We look to peak for a strong Select Flight Invite performance.

Weekly schedule for Phase 1:

- Monday night practices (except after PWs and tournaments)
- Thursday night practices

#### Phase II. Midsummer break.

After SFI go in a two week period of no practice.
Give people a chance to recover mentally and physically, enjoy their summer, come back reenergized.


### Phase III. Ramp up for the series

Jump back in to the season with another practice weekend. Weekly practice schedule resumes with one of:

- 2x weeknights
- 1x weeknight + Saturday AM
- 1x weeknight + Sunday AM/PM

Ramp back up for the series in September.
