He also claims to be from New York.
Fisch moved to Seattle to go to UW. He really likes math. He loves comedy. He loves to laugh!
&amp;ldquo;I love kissing pigs on the lips,&amp;rdquo; Fisch loves to say. &amp;ldquo;I love their rough tongues. I want their rough tongues in my mouth.&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title/><link>https://switchbackultimate.com/roster/2023/brendan-wallace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchbackultimate.com/roster/2023/brendan-wallace/</guid><description>This is Brendan&amp;rsquo;s bio</description></item><item><title/><link>https://switchbackultimate.com/roster/2023/chris-padilla/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchbackultimate.com/roster/2023/chris-padilla/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://switchbackultimate.com/roster/2023/connor-hanify/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchbackultimate.com/roster/2023/connor-hanify/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://switchbackultimate.com/roster/2023/max-bommarito/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchbackultimate.com/roster/2023/max-bommarito/</guid><description>Max Bommarito is from Michigan. He&amp;rsquo;s from Michigan so much that he has a tattoo of a burning couch on his leg (he has told us that this is a Michigan thing). He&amp;rsquo;s a big fan of a twitter account that posts different types of maps of Lansing, Michigan. He used to play for either Hybrid, or High Five, or possibly practice for both of them. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it was High Five but Joe thinks Hybrid so I now think both is possible (but actually now that Joe&amp;rsquo;s not looking, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely High Five).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://switchbackultimate.com/roster/2023/sean-duncan/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchbackultimate.com/roster/2023/sean-duncan/</guid><description>Sean Duncan is from New Jersey. He went to college in either Deleware or Pittsburgh. Or maybe he&amp;rsquo;s from Deleware or Pittsburgh but went to school in New Jersey? But he also went to college in Oregon. Has to be Oregon State, because we make lots of jokes about beavers (the Oregon State mascott) about him. Not really sure what that&amp;rsquo;s about. Maybe a grad degree or something.
Sean used to play on Dark Star.</description></item></channel></rss>
