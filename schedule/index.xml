A practice weekend is an intense &amp;ldquo;on&amp;rdquo; weekend with three practices. This imitates and prepares us for the physical demands of tournaments, and lets us have long continuous blocks of scrimmaging and practice to develop and improve.
A practice weekend looks like:
1st practice late Saturday AM (allows time for travel) break for lunch 2nd practice Saturday afternoon break (either stay on site or go home) 3rd practice early Sunday AM leave Sunday at/before noon The other 8 weekends of the summer are completely free of ultimate obligations.</description></item><item><title>2024 schedule</title><link>https://switchbackultimate.com/schedule/2024/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://switchbackultimate.com/schedule/2024/</guid><description>2024 Schedule Description We envision three phases to the season:
Phase I. Capitalize on initial excitement; make progress on team goals and learn systems This phase kicks off with a big practice weekend (PW1), the team attends Eugene Summer Solstice, possibly Pro Elite Challenge, and Select Flight Invite. We look to peak for a strong Select Flight Invite performance.
Weekly schedule for Phase 1:
Monday night practices (except after PWs and tournaments) Thursday night practices Phase II.</description></item></channel></rss>
