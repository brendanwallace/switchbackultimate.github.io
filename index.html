      <h2>vision</h2>
      <p>
        Seattle should have another competitive men's team. The number of skilled male-matching players outnumber the available roster spots; at the same time, the men's team culture we want to be a part of doesn't exist yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seattle Switchback is our answer: a men's team focused on finding positive team culture in a highly competitive environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've talked a lot about how to best diffuse many of the dynamics that can make men's division experiences feel toxic, as well as what we actively want in a team, and agreed on a set of core values. These are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="core-value">Growth</span>: individual growth and openness
          <div class="core-value-description">
            We seek and accept feedback and criticism, we're open to changing everything from throwing form to decision-making, and we want to grow as individual players.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="core-value">Unity</span>: uniting around an explicit vision of our goals and how to work towards them
          <div class="core-value-description">
            We set goals, expectations, and agenda as a team. We work to distill clarity about what individual and team success means, and believe buy-in is more important than short-term results.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="core-value">Play</span>: commitment to making the most of our time through actual play
          <div class="core-value-description">
            We learn by doing, prioritize touches and time spent playing, commit to making the most of practice, and attend a lot of tournaments.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The pursuit and embodiment of these values separates us from other teams in the men's division. Come climb the mountain with us.
